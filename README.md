# Fancy Gallery

this image configuration makes a pretty way for laying out a gallery.

## Pros

1. the browser itself puts the images in their places after you configure the grid.
2. it is relatively easy to put together this grid configuration.

## Cons

1. making this layout responsive is kind of a challenge.
2. creating the "path" can be quite time consuming and difficult.
